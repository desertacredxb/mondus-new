                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6">
                  The selling process in Dubai is well-defined, although
                  procedural from a legal and documentary perspective when you
                  sell property in Dubai. First of all, the sellers need to
                  prepare the relevant documents such as the title deeds, NOCs,
                  and ID proofs. To attract serious buyers, the property is
                  advertised on various channels. After a buyer's offer has been
                  accepted, a Memorandum of Understanding (Form F) will be
                  signed, and a transfer will take place at the Dubai Land
                  Department.

                  Selling property in Dubai involves several costs you must
                  account for when you sell property in Dubai. The Dubai Land
                  Department takes a percentage of the sale price. Agency
                  commissions go to the broker managing the transaction. You pay
                  NOC charges to the developer for approval. Mortgage clearance
                  fees appear if there's an active loan on the unit. These
                  expenses stay consistent across listings when you sell
                  property in Dubai.

                  photography to make your home the centre of attention, at the
                  same time, featured listings increase the visibility of your
                  property on the major platforms. Targeted advertisements
                  connect the property with the appropriate audience, both
                  locally and internationally, thereby enhancing the chances of
                  a rapid sale when you sell property in Dubai. In addition to
                  this, your property is not only seen by locals but also by
                  investors from all over the world, thanks to international
                  exposure, which gives you maximum opportunities. Besides that,
